> nextep_official is extremely well versed in software engineering and how to succeed in FAANG technical interviews. I went into the mock interview a bit nervous, but I appreciated how he made me feel at ease immediately. I was given a brief overview of what to expect during our session, but not too much so as to keep the session as close to reality as possible. The mock-interview was tailored to the position and level I am aiming to interview. At the end of our session, nextep_official gave very detailed feedback, highlighting my strengths and areas for improvement. He gave helpful pointers that I had not considered for the interviews. I would highly recommend this service!!

> X did a great job in explaining what the interview format would be, and also in simulating the interview very close to the real scenario. After the simulated session, we spent around 20 minutes discussing feedback he had -- it was clear that he took thorough notes, and had a lot of experience in interviewing for system design. He also provided insights to how the interviewer would be thinking about the answers provided. Overall a great experience, and I felt I learned a lot from the detailed feedback.

> X is clearly a very experienced interviewer who conducts the interview as faithful to the real thing as possible. His feedback is on point and he lets you take a glimpse into the mind of the interviewer, what the expectations are and what the real meaning behind the comments happening within the interview is. He spent a good amount of time giving direct feedback right after the interview while everything was fresh in our mind and this was super helpful. Highly recommended.

> Well prepared questions and got a in-depth discussion. A little bit un-common about this design is that, generally in design interview, it's expected to write down requirements, calculations, api/entities design first. This design is suggested to draw diagrams first and add those designs along the way. Good and detailed feedbacks. Very helpful.
